All asm files are in "3410_programs" directory.
All header files including some I made (interpolate_header.h and compute_b_proc.h) are in the "include" directory.
Other supporting files are in each "lib" and "bin" irectories.

Please replace your "build.bat" in 3410_programs, then the program should work.

Thank you.
